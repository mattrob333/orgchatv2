Okay, this is a fantastic and increasingly relevant concept! Let's break it down.

One-Pager Explainer: "OrgChart AI" - Your Augmented Collaboration Hub

Concept:
OrgChart AI revolutionizes internal collaboration by transforming your standard organizational chart into an interactive, intelligent interface. Imagine clicking on any colleague's profile in the org chart and instantly engaging in a productive conversation with their AI-powered "Digital Twin" â€“ a smart clone that knows their schedule, tasks, and ongoing projects.

How It Works:
Each node in the org chart represents an AI agent, a digital replica of a team member. This agent is equipped with:

Personalized Knowledge: Secure access to the individual's calendar, task lists (e.g., Jira, Asana), and project documentation.

Custom Instructions: Tailored system prompts defining its role, communication style, and operational boundaries.

Flexible AI Models: The ability to use the best LLM for specific roles or tasks (e.g., a highly analytical model for a data scientist's clone, a creative one for marketing).

Team members can query these digital twins to:

Get quick status updates without interrupting colleagues.

Find out availability for meetings.

Understand current project priorities.

Delegate simple tasks or pass on information asynchronously.

Get answers to common questions related to that person's role.

The real team member can later review their clone's interactions, ensuring accuracy and staying informed of requests made in their absence.

Key Benefits:

Reduced Interruptions & Increased Focus: Get answers without pulling colleagues out of deep work.

Enhanced Asynchronous Collaboration: Delegate and query 24/7, regardless of time zones or availability.

Instant Information Access: Quickly find project details, availability, and task statuses.

Improved Knowledge Sharing & Retention: Centralizes role-specific knowledge, making it accessible even if someone is OOO or leaves the company.

Streamlined Onboarding: New hires can "talk" to team members' clones to understand roles and ongoing work.

Efficient Delegation: Pass on tasks and information reliably, with a record for the human to review.

Personalized AI Assistance: Each agent is tailored to the individual, providing more relevant and context-aware support than a generic AI.

OrgChart AI isn't just a chatbot; it's a dynamic, intelligent layer over your organization, empowering every team member to work smarter and more collaboratively.

Product Requirements Document (PRD): OrgChart AI

1. Introduction
OrgChart AI is an internal collaboration tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to create AI-powered "Digital Twins" for each member of an organization. These twins are accessible via an interactive org chart interface. Users can click on a node (representing a person/role) to open a chat interface (leveraging the Vercel AI SDK Chatbot "canvas feature") and interact with the AI clone. Each clone will have its own system instructions, knowledge base (calendar, tasks, projects), and a configurable underlying LLM.

2. Goals

To reduce synchronous communication overhead and interruptions.

To improve asynchronous collaboration and information accessibility.

To provide a personalized AI assistant for each team member, capable of handling role-specific queries.

To streamline delegation and status reporting.

To leverage the Vercel AI SDK Chatbot for a robust and extensible chat experience.

3. Target Users

Team Members (All Employees): Primary users who will interact with the clones for information, delegation, and status updates.

Managers/Leads: Will use it for team oversight, delegation, and understanding workload distribution.

Administrators: Responsible for setting up and configuring the org chart, individual agent settings (prompts, KBs, models), and managing data integrations.

4. User Stories

As a Team Member, I want to:

View an interactive organizational chart to understand team structures.

Click on a person in the org chart to open a chat window with their AI clone.

Ask an AI clone about their human counterpart's availability based on their calendar.

Ask an AI clone for the status of a specific task they are working on.

Ask an AI clone about their human counterpart's current project involvement.

Delegate a simple informational task or pass a message to an AI clone for their human to review later.

Receive accurate and contextually relevant answers based on the clone's specialized knowledge.

As a Human counterpart to an AI Clone, I want to:

Have my AI clone securely access my work calendar, task manager, and relevant project documents.

Review a log of conversations my AI clone has had on my behalf.

(Future) Approve or reject actions my clone proposes to take (e.g., scheduling a meeting).

As an Administrator, I want to:

Define the structure of the organizational chart (manually or via API integration).

Configure each AI clone (node) individually.

Set a unique system prompt for each AI clone defining its persona, role, and boundaries.

Connect specific knowledge base sources (e.g., links to individual calendar feeds, task board queries, document repositories) for each AI clone.

Select the specific LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3, Grok) to power each AI clone.

Manage user access and permissions.

Monitor system usage and performance.

5. Functional Requirements

5.1 Org Chart Interface

FR1.1 Display: Render an interactive org chart based on defined data. The visual style should be similar to the provided mockup (dark theme, clear hierarchy, node cards with name, title, department).

FR1.2 Node Information: Each node card should display the person's name, title, and department/team. A small avatar placeholder is also present.

FR1.3 Interactivity:

Clicking on a node card (e.g., "Sarah Chen") will trigger the chat interface for that specific AI clone.

(Mockup feature) Each node has "Chat" and "Settings" buttons. "Chat" opens the chat interface. "Settings" (for admins or the user themselves) would link to the agent configuration.

FR1.4 Navigation: Support basic pan and zoom functionalities for navigating larger org charts (as suggested by zoom/reset controls in the mockup's top right).

FR1.5 Data Source: The org chart data (names, roles, reporting structure) should be configurable, initially via a structured file (e.g., JSON), with potential for future HRIS API integration.

5.2 Chat Interface (Vercel AI SDK "Canvas Feature" Adaptation)

FR2.1 Invocation: When a node is clicked, the chat interface should open, clearly indicating which AI clone the user is interacting with (e.g., "Chatting with Sarah Chen's AI Assistant").

FR2.2 Core Chat Functionality: Leverage components and logic from the Vercel AI SDK Chatbot:

User input area.

Display of chat history (user prompts and AI responses).

Streaming of AI responses.

Support for Markdown rendering in responses.

FR2.3 Contextual Chat: Each chat session is with a specific AI clone. The backend must route requests to the correct agent with its unique configuration.

FR2.4 UI Integration: The chat interface might appear as a modal, a slide-out panel (similar to the Vercel AI SDK's "canvas" for artifacts), or replace a section of the screen. The mockup shows a main area for the org chart; the chat would overlay or be adjacent.

5.3 AI Clone (Agent) Functionality

FR3.1 Unique Identity: Each node in the org chart corresponds to a distinct AI agent.

FR3.2 System Instructions: Each agent must have its own configurable system prompt (e.g., "You are the AI assistant for Sarah Chen, CEO. Your goal is to provide information about her schedule, current high-level projects, and company strategy. Be concise and professional.").

FR3.3 Knowledge Base Integration (RAG):

Each agent must be connectable to specific data sources forming its knowledge base.

Initial KBs:

Calendar: Ability to ingest iCal feeds or connect to calendar APIs (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar) to answer availability questions.

Tasks: Ability to ingest task data (e.g., via CSV export, or API queries to Jira, Asana, Trello) to provide task statuses.

Projects: Ability to ingest documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD) related to the person's projects.

The system must perform Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) over these specific KBs for the respective agent.

FR3.4 Model Selection: Each agent must allow an administrator to select the LLM that powers it from a list of supported models (e.g., configured via environment variables like in lib/ai/models.ts).

FR3.5 Response Generation: Agent responses must be based on the user's prompt, its unique system instructions, its specific knowledge base, and the selected LLM.

FR3.6 Data Access Logging: Log (for the human counterpart and admins) what data sources were accessed by the clone to generate a response.

5.4 Human Oversight & Interaction

FR4.1 Chat Log Review: The human individual (e.g., the real Sarah Chen) should be able to view a history of all conversations their AI clone has had.

FR4.2 Notification System (Future): Notify the human about important interactions or delegations made to their clone.

5.5 Administration & Configuration

FR5.1 Agent Management UI: An admin interface to:

Create, edit, and delete agent configurations.

Define/upload org chart structure.

For each agent:

Set/edit the system prompt.

Manage knowledge base sources (upload documents, configure API links/queries for calendar/tasks). Trigger re-indexing of KBs.

Select the LLM from a predefined list.

FR5.2 User Authentication & Authorization:

Integrate with an existing authentication system (e.g., SSO, or the Auth.js setup from Vercel AI SDK).

Role-based access:

Regular users can view the org chart and chat with clones.

Individuals can view their own clone's logs.

Admins can manage all configurations.

6. Non-Functional Requirements

NFR1 Performance:

Org chart should load quickly (< 3 seconds for up to 200 nodes).

Chat responses should begin streaming within 2-5 seconds of a prompt submission.

NFR2 Scalability:

The system should support up to 200 individual AI agents with distinct KBs.

The RAG system for each agent should perform efficiently.

NFR3 Security:

All sensitive data (KBs, API keys for integrations) must be stored securely.

Access to individual KBs must be strictly limited to the respective AI clone and authorized personnel.

Implement robust input sanitization to prevent prompt injection attacks.

NFR4 Usability: The interface for both users and administrators should be intuitive and easy to use.

NFR5 Maintainability: Code should be well-documented, modular, and leverage the Vercel AI SDK structure for easier updates.

NFR6 Data Privacy: Comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) regarding employee data used in KBs.

7. UI/UX Design Considerations

Org Chart:

Follow the visual style of the provided mockup.

Ensure clear visual hierarchy and readability.

Provide intuitive controls for pan/zoom.

Chat Interface:

Adapt the Vercel AI SDK Chatbot UI.

Clearly display the identity of the AI clone being chatted with.

Provide clear visual cues for AI-generated content vs. user prompts.

Admin Interface:

Simple forms for configuring system prompts, KB sources, and model selection per agent.

Clear dashboards for monitoring and user management.

8. Technical Considerations

Backend: Next.js (as per Vercel AI SDK).

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS (as per Vercel AI SDK).

AI SDK: Vercel AI SDK for chat interactions, model integration, and potentially tool use.

Database: Neon Serverless Postgres (as per Vercel AI SDK) for storing chat histories, agent configurations, org chart data.

Vector Database: Required for RAG for each agent's KB. Options: Vercel Postgres with pgvector, Pinecone, Weaviate, or others compatible with the Vercel ecosystem. Each agent may need its own namespace or index.

File Storage (for KBs): Vercel Blob for storing uploaded documents.

APIs for KBs: Plan for integrations with Google Calendar API, Microsoft Graph API (Outlook), Jira API, Asana API, etc. Securely store API keys/OAuth tokens.

Agent Orchestration: The app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts will need significant modification to:

Identify the target agent based on the selected org chart node.

Load the specific agent's configuration (system prompt, KB connection details, model choice).

Perform RAG against the agent's specific KB before calling the LLM.

Utilize lib/ai/models.ts, prompts.ts, tools/ by adapting them for per-agent dynamic loading/configuration.

9. Future Considerations / Potential Enhancements

Real-time updates to KBs (e.g., via webhooks from calendar/task systems).

AI Clones proactively providing information or suggestions.

AI Clones performing actions on behalf of the user (e.g., scheduling meetings, creating tasks) with an approval workflow.

Advanced analytics on clone interactions and information flow.

Team-level AI agents that aggregate knowledge from multiple individual clones.

Voice interaction with clones.

10. Success Metrics

Reduction in time spent by employees seeking routine information.

Increase in tasks delegated/information passed asynchronously.

User adoption rate and frequency of interaction.

Qualitative feedback from users on usefulness and accuracy.

Number of AI agents successfully configured and utilized.

11. Out of Scope (for V1)

Real-time, bi-directional sync with external systems (initial KB population might be manual or batch).

Clones initiating conversations or performing actions without explicit user interaction or approval.

Complex, granular permission models beyond basic roles.

Support for a large number of LLM providers beyond 3-4 well-supported ones initially.

Advanced natural language analytics on conversation logs.
